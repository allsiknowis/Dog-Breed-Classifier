### Description <a name="description"></a>

This project is part of the Udacity Data Scientist Nanodegree. Its purpose is to show how to build a pipeline that can be used within an app to process real-world, user-supplied images.  Given an image of a dog, the algorithm will identify an estimate of the canineâ€™s breed.  If supplied an image of a human, the code will identify the resembling dog breed.

First, a classifier is trained using the *train_classifier.py* file. This model is saved as a *.json* file to the *saved_models* folder along with an *.hdf5* file containing the best weights determined during training. In order to successfully run this file, additional files from the full [Udacity project repository](https://github.com/udacity/dog-project/) are required.

Second, a web server containing the prediction pipeline is started by the user from the command line by running the *run_server.py* file.

Finally, a prediction can be made utilizing the trained classifier by running the *predict.py* file. By default, a prediction is made on the default image shown below. Otherwise, a file path can be provided as an argument.

#### File Descriptions <a name="files"></a>
`dog_app.ipynb:` A notebook file containing the full walkthrough of the dog breed classification pipeline.

`report.html:` An HTML file of the *dog_app* notebook.

`train_classifier.py:` A Python file used for training a classification model on dog images, saving the best weights found during fitting, and saving the trained model to a .json file.

`run_server.py:` A Python file used for running a web server and predicting a dog breed for a supplied image file using the model trained in *train_classifier.py*

`pred_request:` A Python file used for sending an image to the web server in order to receive a prediction.

`images/Brittany_02625.jpg:` The default file used for prediction when running *pred_request.py* without supplying an image filepath as an argument.

`saved_models/Resnet50_model.json:` The trained model file produced when running *train_classifier.py*

`saved_models/weights.best.Resnet50.hdf5:` The weights file produced during model training when running *train_classifier.py*


### Instructions <a name="instructions"></a>
1. (Optional) Run the following commands in the project's root directory to train the model: 
	`python train_classifier.py`

2. Run the following command in the project's root directory to start the web server in order to make a prediciton.
	`python run_server.py`

3. Run the following command ***in a second command prompt*** in the project's root directory to predict a dog breed for an image.
	- To make a prediction using the default image file: 
		`python pred_request.py`
	- To make a prediction using your own image file: 
		**example** **-** `python pred_request.py --image images\Brittany_02625.jpg`
