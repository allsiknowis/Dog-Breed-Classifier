### Description <a name="description"></a>

This project is part of the Udacity Data Scientist Nanodegree. Its purpose is to show how to build a pipeline that can be used within an app to process real-world, user-supplied images.  Given an image of a dog, the algorithm will identify an estimate of the canineâ€™s breed.  If supplied an image of a human, the code will identify the resembling dog breed.

First, a classifier is trained using the train_classifier.py file in the app folder. This model is saved as a .json file to the saved_models folder along with an .hdf5 file containing the best weights determined during training. In order to successfully run this file, additional files from the full [Udacity project repository](https://github.com/udacity/dog-project/) are required.

Next, a prediction can be made utilizing this trained classifier by running the predict.py file found in the app folder. By default, a prediction is made on the default image shown below. Otherwise, a file path can be provided as an argument.

#### File Descriptions <a name="files"></a>
`dog_app Notebook:` A full walkthrough of the dog breed classification pipeline.

`dog_app HTML:` An HTML file of the dog_app notebook.

`train_classifier.py:` A Python file used for training a classification model on dog images, saving the best weights found during fitting, and saving the model trained model to a .json file.

`predict.py:` A Python file used for predicting a dog breed for a supplied image file using the model trained in train_classifier.py

### Instructions <a name="instructions"></a>
1. Run the following commands in the project's root directory to set up your database and model.
	`python train_classifier.py`

2. Run the following command in the project's root directory to predict a dog breed for an image.
	- To make a prediction using the default image file
		`python predict.py`
	- To make a prediction using your own image file
		example: `python predict.py --image images\Brittany_02625.jpg`
