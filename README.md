### Description <a name="description"></a>

This project is part of the Udacity Data Scientist Nanodegree. Its purpose is to show how to build a pipeline that can be used within an app to process real-world, user-supplied images.  Given an image of a dog, the algorithm will identify an estimate of the canineâ€™s breed.  If supplied an image of a human, the code will identify the resembling dog breed.

First, a classifier is trained via Transfer Learning using the *train_classifier.py* file. Bottleneck features are loaded before the model is compiled and trained on them. This model is saved as a *.json* file to the *saved_models* folder along with an *.hdf5* file containing the best weights determined during training. In order to successfully run this file, additional files from the full [Udacity project repository](https://github.com/udacity/dog-project/) are required.

Second, a web server containing the prediction pipeline is started by the user from the command line by running the *run_server.py* file. Once an image path is sent to the server via the *predict.py* file, the image is opened and read so that it can be checked for the presence of a human face by a face classifier. If a human face is detected, that indication is added to a results list for later printing. The image path is then used to predict a dog breed for the human and the predicted breed is added to a results list. If no human face has been detected, however, the image is checked for the presense of a dog. If a dog is detected in the image, that indication is also added to a results list. (If no dog is detected, an error is displayed.) The image is then converted to a 3D tensor and then to a 4D tensor to be used as input to a classifier. A pre-trained ResNet-50 model is then loaded and used to predict a label classification for the image. Subsequently, that label is used to predict a dog breed using Transfer Learning and the model trained in the step above, and the predicted breed is added to the results list for printing.

Finally, the prediction is output to the screen. By default, a prediction is made on the default image shown below. Otherwise, a file path can be provided as an argument. Admittedly, this model isn't perfect but it does attain about 80% accuracy.
